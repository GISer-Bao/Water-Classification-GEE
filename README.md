## Abstract
　In the context of global climate changes and intensified human activities, efficient and continuous monitoring on surface water dynamics is essential for water resources management and protection. Abundant efforts have been devoted to the task of water mapping base on remote sensing images. However, few studies have fully considered the diverse spectral properties varied with water occurrence differences for the collection of reference samples in an automatic manner. Moreover, the statistics of water area were highly sensitive to the observation quality of satellite images, which lead to significant inconsistency among long-term continuous water datasets. This study aimed to develop a full-automatic GEE-based surface water mapping framework based on supervised random forest classifier. Firstly, we built a robust scheme to automatically construct training samples by merging the information from multi-source water occurrence products, i.e., the Joint Research Center’s (JRC) [Global Surface Water Dataset](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/) (GSWD) and [global inland water dynamics datasets](https://www.glad.umd.edu/dataset/global-surface-water-dynamics) released by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) laboratory. The samples for permanent and seasonal water were mapped and collected separately, and then composited the final sample sets reflecting the spectral diversity of dynamic water targets. Secondly, an automatic temporal correction method was applied to repair the classified maps with invalid observations, thus reduce the uncertainties of derived water occurrence. The proposed framework was tested at five different sites in China. Overall, validation results showed that the proposed method can generate reliable samples (OA: 99.0%, Kappa: 0.966), and produce good-quality water mapping results (OA: 98.6%, Kappa: 0.957). Comparative tests indicated that the proposed method produced water maps with higher quality than the index-based detection methods, as well as GSWD and GLAD datasets. Besides, the temporal correction of contaminated information effectively reduced the uncertainties of derived water statistics. With the full-automatic processing pipeline, the proposed framework can be applied on spatially adaptive scales, thus better delineate the spatial and temporal characteristics of surface water. 

## About the algorithm
* #### This algorithm is based on [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) (GEE) and [geemap](https://geemap.org/), so if you want to use it, it is essential for you to have a GEE account and install geemap.
* **About [GEE](https://earthengine.google.com/)**, it combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. Scientists, researchers, and developers use Earth Engine to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface. Earth Engine is now available for commercial use, and remains free for academic and research use. During the past few years, GEE has become very popular in the geospatial community and it has empowered numerous environmental applications at local, regional, and global scales. GEE provides both JavaScript and Python APIs for making computational requests to the Earth Engine servers.
* **About [geemap](https://geemap.org/)**, it is a Python package for interactive mapping with [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) (GEE), which is a cloud computing platform with a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets.
